# 19€ Smart Home Dashboard with iPad Air Gen1 - Cheap and Fun
Initially, the plan was to build the dashboard from the previous article using a Raspberry Pi and an old laptop display. But then I found a first-generation iPad Air for only 19€ on Kleinanzeigen (classifieds). I simply couldn't resist. The iPad Air Gen1 has a 9.7-inch Retina display with a resolution of 2048 x 1536 pixels, which is absolutely sufficient for a dashboard. Additionally, it's lightweight, compact, and has good battery life. More importantly, however, it's cheaper than a Raspberry Pi with a display, and it's simply more fun to work with an iPad.

## The Concept: Cordova App as Dashboard
Instead of jailbreaking the iPad, I decided to create a Cordova app that displays my dashboard. Cordova allows you to turn web applications into native apps, and it's easy to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to design the user interface. The app runs in full-screen mode and provides a seamless experience.

Additionally, it can be purchased at [Buy me a coffee - Shop](https://buymeacoffee.com/simeonlukas/e/456968) if anyone is interested. Instructions for use are automatically included. Here's a quick guide:

### iOS Kiosk App: How to Install It on Your iPad
#### What You Need

iPad with iOS 12.5.7 or higher  
Computer (Windows or macOS)  
Sideloadly (free)  
Apple ID (free)  
iOS Kiosk App file (.ipa)  

#### Installation in 3 Steps
1. Set up Sideloadly
Download Sideloadly from sideloadly.io and install the software on your computer.
2. Connect iPad
Connect your iPad to the computer via USB cable and confirm the trust request on the iPad.
3. Install App
Open Sideloadly, drag the .ipa file into the program window, enter your Apple ID, select your iPad, and click "Start Sideloading".

#### Initial Setup
When you first launch the app, a configuration window automatically appears. Enter the URL of your desired website or dashboard here and confirm with "OK". The app automatically starts in full-screen mode without a visible status bar.

#### Adjusting Configuration
After the app starts, a "Configuration" button appears for 5 seconds. Tap it to change the displayed URL at any time.

#### Important Notes
Certificate Duration: With a free Apple ID, the app certificate lasts 7 days. After that, you need to reinstall the app. A paid Apple Developer Account (99€/year) extends the duration to 1 year.
Optimal Use: Disable automatic iPad lock in settings and use a stable Wi-Fi connection. For additional security, activating iOS Guided Access under Settings > Accessibility is recommended.

#### Troubleshooting
If the website doesn't load, check the URL for typos and your iPad's internet connection. In case of problems, reinstalling the app via Sideloadly usually helps.

## Conclusion

The iPad Air Gen1 as a smart home dashboard is a clever and cost-effective alternative to Raspberry Pi solutions. For just 19€, you get a high-quality 9.7-inch Retina display with excellent resolution that's perfect for dashboard visualization.

The Cordova-based kiosk app offers an elegant solution without jailbreaking and is incredibly easy to install thanks to Sideloadly. The only downside is the 7-day certificate duration with a free Apple ID – but hey, for 19€, you can also connect the iPad briefly once a week. (Or, like me, you're lucky enough to have a paid Apple Developer Account)

**Advantages at a Glance:**
- Extremely affordable entry (19€ used)
- Brilliant Retina display
- Easy installation without technical knowledge
- No jailbreak necessary
- Compact, lightweight, and energy-efficient

**Disadvantages:**
- Weekly reinstallation with free Apple ID
- Dependent on Sideloadly (no App Store solution)

For anyone looking for an affordable, stylish smart home display who doesn't want to tinker with Raspberry Pi, this solution is perfect. And honestly: it's simply more fun to work with an iPad than with a cobbled-together display setup that might fall apart just by looking at it.
