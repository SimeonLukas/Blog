# Genesis
I think it was 10 years. In any case, we spent a long time looking for our old N64 console. Just before I was about to buy one on Kleinanzeigen, we found it in a white bag in my parents' basement. There was also a PS2 Slim with it. Nostalgia kicked in. I was so happy with the find and looked forward to gaming.

# SC64 N64 Flashcart: The Modern Way to Enjoy N64 Games

As a long-time Nintendo 64 enthusiast, I was always looking for a reliable way to play my favorite games on original hardware. After some research, I discovered the SC64 Flashcart - and I must say, it was one of the best decisions for my retro gaming setup. Additionally, I bought two new controllers from AliExpress, and I was ready for a new adventure with my N64.

## What is the SC64 - SummerCart64?

The SC64 is a modern flashcart for the Nintendo 64 that allows you to load ROMs from an SD card. Compared to older solutions like the 64drive or EverDrive-64, it offers several modern conveniences such as a USB-C connection and excellent PC integration. Furthermore, the entire project is open source and can be viewed on GitHub [https://github.com/Polprzewodnikowy/SummerCart64/](https://github.com/Polprzewodnikowy/N64FlashcartMenu/blob/main/docs/00_getting_started_sd.md).

## Installation and Initial Setup

The SC64 works like a classic flashcart:
- Format SD card with FAT32 or exFAT
- Copy `sc64menu.n64` to the root directory (The manual mentions creating a `menu` folder, but please don't do that)
- Insert SD card into the SC64
- Insert SC64 into the Nintendo 64
- Power on and wait briefly

Everything should work then. Now the root directory of the SD card has a `menu` folder. You can now simply place the ROMs on the SD card (not in `menu`) and you're ready to go. Everything is described and explained on the [website](https://github.com/Polprzewodnikowy/SummerCart64/blob/main/docs/00_quick_startup_guide.md). Additionally, you can use the SC64Deployer program to flash the SC64's firmware, format the SD card, and upload ROMs.

## Conclusion

After several days of intensive use, I can unconditionally recommend the SC64. The combination of user-friendly operation makes it a perfect companion for N64 enthusiasts.

Advantages:
- Easy installation
- Fast ROM loading times
- Reliable save state management
- Modern USB-C connection
- Active firmware development

Disadvantages:
- Price higher than some alternatives

The SC64 is currently the best N64 flashcart on the market for me. It combines modern technology with nostalgic N64 hardware in a way that will excite both casual gamers and hardware enthusiasts.
