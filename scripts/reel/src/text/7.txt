Genesis
I think it was 10 years. In any case, we spent a long time looking for our old N64 console. Just before I was about to buy one on Kleinanzeigen, we found it in a white bag in my parents' basement. There was also a PS2 Slim with it. Nostalgia kicked in. I was so happy with the find and looked forward to gaming.
